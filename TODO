ASAP:
- Add flag to stop rewriting the monitor output (add \n). Default to true on windows. 
- wordlist prefix and postfix (copy my existing code and clean up ;))
--- Replace geline with portable approach
- Move regex_str to worker_param
- Add sqlite3 support
- Test on different windows versions (xp, vista, 8).
- windows processor count detection
- Increase version and update changelog

Sometime or never.
- Search for a faster sha1 impl.
- Find error with -o or remove ? (Always results in invalid onion address for me (calculated onion != real onion))
- Support chained filter (as OR or as AND) .. think about it
- Investigate GPU support
- Investigate the wrong calculated onion problem ("fixed" by verifing "valid" keys for now)
