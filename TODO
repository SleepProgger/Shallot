- Find error with -o or remove ? (Always results in invalid onion address for me (calculated onion != real onion))
- Support more filter (as OR or as AND) .. think about it 
- Move regex_str to worker_param
- Add sqlite3 support
- Search for a faster sha1 impl.
- Investigate GPU support
- Investigate the wrong calculated onion problem ("fixed" by verifing "valid" keys for now)
